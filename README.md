# MachineLearningWithR
This repo contains machine learning algorthims implemented by <b>R<b>
Machine learning is branched into three major methodologies based on functionality of the algorithm.

#Supervised learning:
Supervised learning  algorithm's works on a known dataset (called the training dataset) to make predictions. The training dataset includes independent variables(x)  and dependent(y) values. From those values the supervised learning algorithm with some assumptions build  a model that can make predictions of the depedent values for a new dataset(test data). A test dataset is often used to validate the model. Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.
 
mechanism/flow of the supervised learning:

Supervised learning is again divided into 
1)Regression: gives continous values as output
I have implemeneted som of the regression algorithms to know more about them check teh below links

2)classification:Its output is categorical data or discrete values
