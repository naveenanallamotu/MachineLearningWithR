# MachineLearningWithR
This repo contains machine learning algorthims implemented by <b>R<b>
 Foremost and important step to build a model is have clean data i.e data without noise, data that suitable for the algorithm to build
  I build datapreprocessing template
 DataPreprocessing:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/DataPreprocessing 
  After that start build models using machine learning algorithms and this algoritms are cateogrized as follow
Machine learning is branched into three major methodologies based on functionality of the algorithm.

  #Supervised learning:
Supervised learning  algorithm's works on a known dataset (called the training dataset) to make predictions. The training dataset includes independent variables(x)  and dependent(y) values. From those values the supervised learning algorithm with some assumptions build  a model that can make predictions of the depedent values for a new dataset(test data). A test dataset is often used to validate the model. Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.
 mechanism/flow of the supervised learning:

Supervised learning is again divided into 
1)Regression: gives continous values as output
I have implemeneted som of the regression algorithms to know more about them check teh below links
Linear regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/LinearRegression
multilinear regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/MultiplelinearRegression
polynomial regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/PolynomialRegression
Desicion tree regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/DecisionTreeRegression
Random forest regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/RandomForestRegression
Support vector regression:https://github.com/naveenanallamotu/MachineLearningWithR/wiki/SupportVectorRegression

2)classification:Its output is categorical data or discrete values
